# CrisisSense
A low-power embedded sensor. Currently working on the feature/sensor branch.

Progress so far:
- UART debugging: Simple terminal debugging over USART.
- Sensor Integration: SPI driver written and BME280 api integrated. Soldering issues and school have delayed progress.

Future Steps:
- De-solder and re-solder 
- Fully Test Sensor Integration
- Sensor reading over UART demonstration
- Start work on communication module
